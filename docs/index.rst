===========================================
Welcome to DroneKit-Python's documentation!
===========================================

DroneKit's Python API helps you create powerful apps for air-based control of UAVs. These apps run on a UAV's :ref:`Companion Computer <supported-companion-computers>`, and augment the autopilot by performing tasks that are both computationally intensive and require a low-latency link (e.g. computer vision). 

This documentation provides everything you need to :ref:`get started <get-started>` with DroneKit-Python, including an :doc:`overview <about/overview>` of the API, guide material, a number of demos and examples, and :doc:`API Reference <automodule>`.
